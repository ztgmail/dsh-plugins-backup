 * Anonymous install telemetry shared by the DSH Web UI family plugins.

 * Once per UTC day per browser, each wired plugin sends one heartbeat to
 * the dsh-market edge API listing its package name (and version when known).
 * The payload carries no conversation data and no identifiers beyond a random
 * UUID generated in localStorage; the server hashes it with a deployment salt
 * before storage and never persists IP addresses. Sends are fire-and-forget:
 * failures stay silent and simply retry on a later mount or day. The system
 * is documented in docs/telemetry.md.
