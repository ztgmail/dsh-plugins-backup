/**
 * Reading the plugin catalog out of a published npm package.
 *
 * The catalog's own host is the thing being worked around. `plugins.json` is
 * served from GitHub Pages, and the public GitHub proxies that make GitHub
 * usable from mainland China refuse any hostname that is not github.com's
 * own — measured: the project domain comes back 403. So the file cannot be
 * carried through the same route as everything else while it lives there.
 *
 * Published to npm it can be. Every China npm mirror already carries it, it
 * is the same infrastructure the plugins themselves arrive on, and it needs
 * no service that did not already have to work. It also gains a version
 * number, which the origin never had: a catalog build that ships bad data
 * can be rolled back instead of only being fixed forwards.
 *
 * Mirrors rewrite `dist.tarball` to point at themselves, so following that
 * field is what keeps the download on the mirror rather than bouncing back
 * to the origin registry — verified against the Tencent mirror, which serves
 * its own host in that field.
