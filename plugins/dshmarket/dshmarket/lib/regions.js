 * on GitHub — the plugin catalog, update checks, package downloads, author
 * avatars, README screenshots. From mainland China several of those can be
 * slow, which is why this is ONE setting rather than a
 * row of them: "npm mirror", "GitHub proxy" and "image proxy" are three
 * spellings of a single question the user is actually being asked, which is
 * where they are.
 *
 * The routing table is the single source of truth. Every consumer asks it
 * rather than reaching for a hardcoded host, so adding a region is a table
 * entry instead of a search across six modules.
 *
 * Each route has an environment escape hatch, following `DSHM_REGISTRY_URL`
 * (src/registry.ts). The China route has service-specific public-proxy
 * fallbacks; those come and go, and a user whose routes have died needs a way
 * out that is not "wait for the next release".

 * hostname", which #460 by @Homplex measured as wrong in both directions —
 * re-measured 2026-09-01:
 *
 *   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/…   200   ← not a github.com hostname

 *   https://example.com/                  403
 *
 * So a plain repository page is refused while raw content is served. Do not
 * reason about this proxy from the hostname; check the specific service, and
 * re-measure rather than infer, because the policy is the operator's and can
 * change under us. That fragility is the substance of #460's actual request
