 * Download regions: which route the market's own network requests take.

 * on GitHub — the plugin catalog, update checks, package downloads, author
 * avatars, README screenshots. From mainland China several of those can be
 * slow, which is why this is ONE setting rather than a
 * row of them: "npm mirror", "GitHub proxy" and "image proxy" are three
 * spellings of a single question the user is actually being asked, which is
 * where they are.
 *
 * The routing table is the single source of truth. Every consumer asks it
 * rather than reaching for a hardcoded host, so adding a region is a table
 * entry instead of a search across six modules.
 *
 * Each route has an environment escape hatch, following `DSHM_REGISTRY_URL`
 * (src/registry.ts). The China route has service-specific public-proxy
 * fallbacks; those come and go, and a user whose routes have died needs a way
 * out that is not "wait for the next release".
