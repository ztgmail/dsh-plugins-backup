/**
 * Restart-free installs: mount a freshly installed plugin into the running
 * composition through a market-owned Include subtree.
 *
 * Durable state stays with the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` (reconciled by
 * the dsh CLI at install time), so the next boot loads the plugin through the
 * normal bundle layer. The subtree here exists only for the current process:
 * its input files live under `<profile>/.dsh-market/` and are wiped on every
 * boot, so a crash can never leave a file that collides with the bundle layer
 * (inserting an id the bundle layer also inserts is a hard boot failure).
 * `state.json` in the same directory is the market's own durable state
 * (disable list + custom groups) and deliberately survives the wipe.
 *
 * The Include subclass suppresses `write()` — the loader otherwise persists
 * tree changes back to the file it read (see dsh's agent-presets PresetTree
 * for the in-tree precedent).

 * `notes` keeps its original rule — an explicit object wins, including an
 * empty one, because deleting the last note has to be expressible. What made
 * #435 lose notes was not this function but a caller: the note route wrote
 * through a fresh read while the long-lived `marketState` in routes.ts still
 * carried `notes: {}` from boot, and the next write from that object put the
 * empty one back. The fix for that belongs at the call site, where the two
 * copies are, not here — see the note route.

 * already doing filesystem work, and it is what makes "this function writes
