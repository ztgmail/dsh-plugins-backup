/**
 * Resolving a GitHub install through a region's proxy without proxying the
 * tarball pnpm records.
 *
 * pnpm does not fetch `github:owner/repo` with `git clone`; it resolves the
 * shortcut and downloads a tarball from codeload.github.com. That rules out
 * the usual `git config insteadOf` trick — there is no git command to
 * redirect.
 *
 * Prefix-proxying that tarball used to save substantial time, but pnpm 11's
 * fail-closed lockfile checks changed the safety boundary. A URL shaped like
 * `https://proxy/https://codeload.github.com/.../<commit>` no longer has the
 * codeload hostname, so pnpm treats it as an ordinary remote tarball and
 * requires an integrity hash that its GitHub resolver does not write. The
 * result is ERR_PNPM_MISSING_TARBALL_INTEGRITY on the install itself (#385).
 * Disabling that check or minting a checksum from whatever the proxy served
 * would weaken pnpm's supply-chain protection, so neither is acceptable.
 *
 * The safe middle ground is to resolve HEAD through the regional proxy, then
 * hand pnpm a commit-pinned `github:owner/repo#<sha>` target. The ref lookup
 * still avoids a slow or unreachable GitHub metadata request; pnpm itself
 * fetches the canonical codeload URL, records it as `gitHosted: true`, and
 * keeps its integrity policy intact.
 *
 * - **The commit has to be pinned.** The profile reads each plugin's
 *   installed commit back out of the lockfile by matching a codeload URL
 *   ending in a 40-character SHA (src/profile.ts). A `HEAD` tarball installs
 *   perfectly and then reports no version forever. So this resolves the SHA
 *   first, and a rewrite that cannot get one does not happen.
 * - **Build-script approval has to keep matching.** `gitAllowBuildsKey`
 *   (src/sources.ts) derives its stable key from the repo, and the pinned
 *   GitHub form preserves that identity.
 *
 * Catalog subpath entries are left alone: `#path:` identifies a different
 * package inside the repo, so the acceleration step never rewrites that
 * fragment. Collection roots discovered after install preserve the resolved
 * commit and add their subpath as pnpm's second `&path:` selector.
 *
 * Every SHA-lookup failure falls back to the original target. Acceleration
 * is an optimisation, and an optimisation that can fail an install is a bug.

/**
 * The commit `HEAD` points at, from git's own ref advertisement.
 *
 * This is the endpoint `git clone` reads before it fetches anything, and it
 * is the right one here for two measured reasons. It is not the REST API, so
 * it does not consume the 60-requests-per-hour unauthenticated quota that a
 * user installing a handful of plugins could plausibly exhaust. And it
 * survives the proxy: over five consecutive tries from an unproxied mainland
 * connection it answered 200 in ~1.2s every time, while the REST API through
 * the same proxy returned 200, 200, then 403 — a proxy that rate-limits the
 * API path would silently drop every install back to the slow route.
 *
 * The response is git's pkt-line format, whose first ref line carries
 * `<sha> HEAD\0<capabilities>`. Read with a pattern rather than a parser:
 * one 40-character hex string followed by `HEAD` is unambiguous in this
 * payload, and a length-prefix reader would be more code to get wrong.
 *
 * The same advertisement lists every branch and tag, which is what `ref`
 * uses. A plugin installed from `github:owner/repo#publish` is not asking
 * about the default branch at all, and answering with it made the market
 * report an update forever (#446) — the two SHAs simply never match. Both
 * namespaces are searched because pnpm accepts a tag there too, branches
 * first since that is what the reports are about.
 * @param ref - branch or tag to resolve, or undefined for the default branch.
