/**
 * Deciding a download region by asking the network, once.
 *
 * The alternative was reading the system time zone, and it is wrong for
 * exactly the people who most need this to work: someone in Shanghai behind
 * a corporate proxy or a VPN reaches the official registry perfectly well
 * and would be routed onto mirrors they do not need, while a Chinese-locale
 * machine sitting in Singapore would be routed onto mirrors that are further
 * away than the origin. A time zone says where a clock is. It does not say
 * what the network can reach, which is the only question here.
 *
 * So the probe measures the thing itself: it asks both registries for the
 * same small document and takes whichever answers first. That is
 * self-correcting in a way a lookup table cannot be — the machine behind the
 * proxy measures fast official access and stays global, without anyone
 * having to enumerate the exceptions.
 *
 * It runs ONCE, when no region has ever been decided, and its answer is
 * persisted as the decision. Re-probing every boot would let a market
 * silently change routes between runs, which is the kind of behaviour that
 * makes "it was fast yesterday" impossible to debug.
