/**
 * giscus wiring for the in-market comment thread.
 *
 * A plugin has ONE discussion, whether the reader reached it from
 * dshmarket.com, from the awesome-dsh-plugin catalog, or from inside the
 * market itself. That is only true as long as three things agree across the
 * three surfaces: the repository ids below, the `plugin:<slug>` term, and the
 * slug those terms are built from. The ids here mirror site/comments.mjs and
 * the slug mirrors scripts/build-site.mjs; both are asserted in
 * tests/client/comments.client.spec.ts against the real files, because a
 * silent disagreement does not fail — it forks the conversation in half and
 * nobody notices until someone asks why their comment vanished.
