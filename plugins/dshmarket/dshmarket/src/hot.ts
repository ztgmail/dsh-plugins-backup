 * `notes` keeps its original rule — an explicit object wins, including an
 * empty one, because deleting the last note has to be expressible. What made
 * #435 lose notes was not this function but a caller: the note route wrote
 * through a fresh read while the long-lived `marketState` in routes.ts still
 * carried `notes: {}` from boot, and the next write from that object put the
 * empty one back. The fix for that belongs at the call site, where the two
 * copies are, not here — see the note route.
