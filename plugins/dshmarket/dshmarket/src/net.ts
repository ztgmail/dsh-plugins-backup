/**
 * Outbound HTTP for the market's own server-side calls.
 *
 * Node's global `fetch` ignores `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` entirely
 * (measured on Node 25: a request with an unreachable proxy configured still
 * succeeds directly, and setting `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` at runtime changes
 * nothing — it is read at startup). On a machine whose route out is a local
 * proxy, that is not a slowdown but a different network: the catalog fetch
 * took 9.9s direct on a reporter's machine, seconds from the 15s timeout,
 * while their proxy sat unused a millisecond away.
 *
 * `setGlobalDispatcher` from the `undici` PACKAGE cannot fix this, because
 * `globalThis.fetch` runs on Node's INTERNAL copy of undici — a different
 * instance. Verified: with a dispatcher installed, a global fetch still
 * produced no CONNECT at a local proxy, while undici's own fetch produced
 * `CONNECT awesome-dsh-plugin.com:443`.
 *
 * So the market calls undici's fetch with an explicit dispatcher. The scope
 * is deliberate: only requests made by this module change, and the host's
 * own networking is left exactly as the host configured it.

/**
 * The proxy this process would use for the catalog, if any.
 *
 * The standard variables mirror `EnvHttpProxyAgent`'s own resolution
 * deliberately, rather than picking the order that reads best, because the
 * same answer does two jobs: it decides whether to route through undici at
 * all, and it is what the failure message CLAIMS was tried. A helper that
 * named a proxy undici would not have used would put a false statement in
 * every bug report. `npm_config_*` is an additional source on top of that:
 * npm holds its proxy in its own config namespace (a machine set up with
 * `npm config set proxy` has the proxy in `npm_config_proxy` and nowhere
 * else), and undici does not read it — so it is resolved here and handed to
 * the agent explicitly in `marketFetch`.
 *
 * Three details are undici's, not ours (env-http-proxy-agent.js):
 *   - lowercase wins over uppercase (`https_proxy ?? HTTPS_PROXY`)
 *   - an https request falls back to the http proxy when no https one is set
 *   - the value is tested for truthiness, so `HTTPS_PROXY=` — which is how
 *     people turn a proxy off — falls through instead of masking HTTP_PROXY
 *
 * Blank-is-unset is ours, and only widens that last one: undici would hand a
 * whitespace-only value to `new URL()` and throw out of the constructor.
 * Scheme-less host:port values are also common in Windows proxy fields and
 * npm config; proxy agents require URLs, so those default to `http://`.
