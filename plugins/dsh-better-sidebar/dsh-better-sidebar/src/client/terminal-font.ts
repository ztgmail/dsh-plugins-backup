/**
 * Icon fonts appended to whichever base stack wins, so shell prompts that
 * draw glyphs from the Nerd Font Private Use Areas resolve to a real glyph
 * instead of the missing-glyph box (aka tofu).
 *
 * Why this is needed even though the OS "should" fall back automatically:
 * prompt frameworks (starship, powerlevel10k, oh-my-posh) take their icons
 * from the PUA. Chromium's implicit system fallback reliably covers the
 * *BMP* PUA (U+E000–U+F8FF — e.g. the U+E0B0 powerline separator) but NOT
 * the *supplementary-plane* PUA-B (U+F0000+) where Nerd Fonts v3 relocated
 * the Material Design icon set. Naming the families explicitly makes the
 * browser consult them per character, which covers both planes.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT listed: color-emoji families. Chromium routes genuine
 * emoji code points through a dedicated emoji fallback path (which is why
 * emoji already render), so naming them buys nothing here — while placing a
 * color font ahead of the generic family risks capturing BMP symbols the
 * prompt expects in monospace (U+26A0 ⚠, U+2714 ✔ …) and rendering them as
 * wide color glyphs that break the cell grid.
 *
 * Ordering rationale: the symbols-only patches ship glyphs without Latin,
 * so they can never hijack ASCII metrics — the safest first hop. The
 * fully-patched distributions follow for users who installed one of those
 * instead. Both the `… Mono` and proportional family names are listed
 * because the Nerd Fonts installers register them as distinct families.
 *
 * These are strictly *appended*, never prepended: xterm derives its cell
 * metrics from the first entry, so the base font must stay in front or the
 * whole grid would be re-measured against an icon font.
