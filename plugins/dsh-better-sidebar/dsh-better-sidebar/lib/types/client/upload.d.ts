/**
 * File-upload plumbing for the files window: turn a file picker or a drag-drop
 * into per-file raw-byte uploads through the sidebar's `/sidebar/upload` route.
 *
 * Folders keep their tree in both flows: the picker's `webkitdirectory`
 * selection arrives as Files with `webkitRelativePath` filled, and dropped
 * folders — which never surface in `dataTransfer.files` — are traversed via
 * `webkitGetAsEntry`, so the relative path is preserved for every nested file
 * and the host recreates the tree under the chosen directory. The File is
 * streamed straight into the POST body (no base64 inflation); uploads run
 * sequentially so one slow file cannot starve the others, and each result
 * reports its own outcome (the tree keeps going after a failure). An
 * optional `AbortSignal` stops the queue at the next item boundary and
 * aborts the in-flight request; the host cleans up its temp file when the
 * request stream dies.
