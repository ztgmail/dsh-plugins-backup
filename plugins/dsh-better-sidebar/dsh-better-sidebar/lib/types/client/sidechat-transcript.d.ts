/**
 * Side Chat transcript mapping (browser half): turns a thread child's own
 * events (`sidechat.events` — the plugin route, which reads the log without
 * activating the child and cuts the inherited seed host-side) into compact
 * display rows.
 *
 * A thread child's log starts with the ENTIRE inherited parent log as its
 * fork seed. The route already cuts everything up to the LAST
 * `session/end-seed` marker; the mapping re-applies the same cut so any
 * seed event that somehow crosses the wire still never renders, and maps
 * context injections (the "Side conversation boundary" prompt,
 * plugin-sourced context) onto a collapsible injection row, so the view
 * shows only the thread's own conversation.
 *
 * Live streaming: `assistant/message` events only land when a step
 * completes, but `assistant/chunk` events stream token-level text and
 * reasoning deltas. The mapping accumulates both per block and supersedes
 * them with the assembled message once it lands (settled rows).
