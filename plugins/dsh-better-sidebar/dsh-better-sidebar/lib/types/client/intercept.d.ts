 * load-time validation throws "not declared (a parent entry's children
 * table must declare it)" when the parent entry is not on the ledger yet.
 * slots.inject waits for the declaration: the callback runs synchronously
 * when the slot is already declared, otherwise it runs inside the declaring
 * register() call once the declaration commits; declaration collapse
 * disposes the entry and a later declaration re-registers it. This mirrors
 * @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-deliverables' registration of the same slot.

 * file open goes through on alpha hosts (tool-row path links, the
 * produced-files row, prose mentions, inline-code paths) — so opens land in
 * the sidebar editor instead of the Host OS. The folder-reveal gesture
 * ("Show in folder" passes `'.'`) is the one exception: it is routed to the
 * explorer. Gated by BOTH the `interceptOpenPath` pref and the editor tab's
 * enable switch; declined opens fall through to the original remote call.
 *
 * The `remote.session` namespace service mounts asynchronously (the gateway
 * client creates it when the session-controller contribution arrives) and
 * is recreated on contribution remounts, so the wrapper installs through
 * `ctx.inject`: the callback runs once the service exists and re-runs after
 * every remount, re-applying the shadow on the fresh instance. Returns the
 * disposer (disposes the inject fiber, which restores the original method
 * descriptor — HMR-safe).
