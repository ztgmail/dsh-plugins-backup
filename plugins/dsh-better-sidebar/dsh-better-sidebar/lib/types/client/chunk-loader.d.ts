/**
 * Lazy chunk loader for the client bundle. The heavy preview/terminal
 * libraries (CodeMirror, xterm — the editor/terminal stacks, several MB)
 * live in separate build-time bundles (`lib/client-<name>.js`) fetched only
 * on first use of the feature that needs them, so startup downloads/parses
 * only the ~1MB core bundle. (The office stack — Univer / docx-preview /
 * pptx-renderer — is no longer bundled here: Office previews moved to the
 * recommended office plugin, see plugins-viewers.ts.)
 *
 * How a chunk script works (see tsdown.config.ts chunkBundle):
 *
 *   globalThis.__dshChunks__ = globalThis.__dshChunks__ || {};
 *   globalThis.__dshChunks__["terminal"] = (require) => { ...exports };
 *
 * The script registers its factory on a plugin-owned global registry (NOT
 * through window.__ModuleLoader__.load — the module loader's import() only
 * resolves seed words, shell-own modules, registered factories, and boot
 * graph rows; a chunk id is none of those, so resolution would be version-
 * dependent). Materialization is plugin-owned:
 *
 * 1. inject <script src="/sidebar/bundle/<name>.js"> (classic same-origin
 *    script; the official /plugins/<id>/client.js route cannot serve
 *    arbitrary file names, so the plugin's own host route serves the chunks),
 * 2. read the factory from the global registry,
 * 3. call it with a require that resolves the platform externals through
 *    `__DSH_MODULES__.import(spec)` — the seed-word branch, the one part of
 *    the module system that is stable across versions.
 *
 * Caching contract (three layers, each with a failure path):
 * - In-memory: one in-flight promise per chunk, memoized until
 *   {@link resetChunks}; a failed load removes its entry so the next call
 *   retries from scratch. HMR re-activation keeps the resolved exports of
 *   unchanged chunks (ETag revalidation via
 *   {@link revalidateChunksOnReactivate}) — the next lazy open skips the
 *   re-inject / re-execute.
 * - Script execution: each re-execution overwrites the global registry slot
 *   (assignment, never registration) — no "duplicate factory registration"
 *   class of errors; a failed materialization clears the cache so the retry
 *   re-injects and re-executes.
 * - HTTP: the bundle route revalidates every request (`cache-control:
 *   no-cache` + ETag, 304 when unchanged), so page refreshes and HMR
 *   re-activations never re-download a multi-MB chunk that did not change.
 *
 * HMR: each plugin activation calls {@link revalidateChunksOnReactivate},
 * which HEADs every loaded chunk against the bundle route and keeps the
 * in-memory cache for the ones whose ETag is unchanged (a hot-reloaded core
 * bundle therefore does not re-execute multi-MB chunk scripts). Chunk-only
 * source edits still need a manual page refresh (the HMR poll watches only
 * client.js); an edit that does land while a core HMR happens is caught by
 * the ETag comparison on the next activation.
