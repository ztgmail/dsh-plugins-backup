/**
 * Built-in desktop-shell presets for the "位置兼容模式" secondary setting
 * (scheme `preset`). DATA-DRIVEN by design: each shell's adaptation lives
 * in one entry (strip values / optional CSS), the core applies it through
 * the SAME generic strip variable and CSS-injection mechanism — adding a
 * shell is adding data, never a code path.
 *
 * Inclusion rule (maintained in docs/external-plugin-guide.md §12): only shells that (a) appear
 * in this repo's issues/PRs (a user actually hit a problem) and (b) have
 * 100+ GitHub stars (a real user base). The mechanism is opt-in: auto
 * detection never applies a preset — the settings badge only SUGGESTS it.
