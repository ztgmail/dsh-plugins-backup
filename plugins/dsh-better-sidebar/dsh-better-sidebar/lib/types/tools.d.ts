 * session (`registry.assertOwned`), so one agent can never reach another
 * session's terminals.
 * @param ctx - host plugin context (carries the tools service).
 * @param registry - the agent-owned terminal registry.
 * @param resolveCwd - async cwd resolver for one session id. Resolves through
 *  the session header, the client-supplied cwd, and the persistence index
 *  before falling back to the host process cwd (production always provides
 *  persistence, so the fallback is reached only in tests / stripped-down hosts).
 * @returns a disposer that unregisters all eight tools (the caller gates
 * registration on the side-card setting and calls this to turn them off).
