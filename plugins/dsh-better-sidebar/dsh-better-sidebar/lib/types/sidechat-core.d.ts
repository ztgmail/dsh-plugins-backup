 *
 * A side thread is a child session the plugin creates ITSELF with a custom
 * seed — the parent session's FULL event log up to the click moment
 * (completed turns, the unanswered user message, and — when the parent is
 * mid-turn — the in-progress assistant output and tool activity). The log
 * model forbids open-turn seeds, so an in-flight parent turn is copied
 * verbatim and CLOSED with synthetic `step/end` + `turn/end{reason:
 * 'interrupted'}` events: the child sees the partial turn as honestly
 * frozen ("cut off"), never as a completed answer. The one case that cannot
 * be closed honestly — a tool call still executing (no `tool/result` yet;
 * providers reject dangling assistant calls) — falls back to cutting before
 * the open turn and carrying the partial content as a structured text
 * snapshot inside the boundary prompt.
