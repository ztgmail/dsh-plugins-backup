/**
 * Host half of the auto-continue plugin.
 *
 * - Registers the `auto-continue` settings namespace (the browser half's
 *   settings card edits it; the host engine reads it).
 * - Runs the single-instance auto-continue engine: listens to the session
 *   event firehose, sends via `agent.followup`, cancels via `agent.cancel`.
 * - Serves a status bridge the browser half subscribes to: notifications and
 *   runtime state (stats / pauses), plus an action endpoint for notification
 *   buttons.
