and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- The shipped default queue is one order again: v0.1.9 moved Firecrawl to the front of the `cordis.patch.yml` base layer but missed `DEFAULT_QUEUE` in `src/config.ts` (the schema default that fills the settings section on a fresh install), leaving Firecrawl mid-queue there. The code default now matches the patch layer — anysearch, then Firecrawl, then Tavily onward — and the config test locks the order.
- The upstream attribution `User-Agent` is un-stuck from 0.1.8: it now follows the package version again (`dsh-web-search-aggregation/0.1.10`), per the constant's own "bump with the package version" contract.
- `CHANGELOG.md` catches up on bookkeeping: the 0.1.8 notes had been left under [Unreleased], and 0.1.9 shipped with no entry at all. Both are backfilled below.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- The `cordis.patch.yml` composition layer now disables the built-in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-search-deepseek` row (`disabled: true`), so its `deepseek-official` provider never registers and its settings card disappears when this plugin's layer applies. The disable is order-stable (a patch replaces a row's config, not its other keys, and no shipped layer re-enables it) and reversible from a profile layer with `disabled: false`; a custom profile without the dsh-base row just logs a loader warning and continues. This makes the `searchProvider: aggregated` pin load-bearing: a later bundle layer restating the shipped selection (dsh-web-fetch-playwright's does) would point the seam at the unloaded provider and fail every web_search with `WEB_PROVIDER_CONFIGURED_MISSING` — order this plugin last in `dsh.profile.bundles` or re-pin both keys in the profile's own `cordis.patch.yml` in such a deployment (ordering caveat documented in the patch header).
- Default queue reorder in the patch layer: **Firecrawl** moves up to the second slot (right after AnySearch), ahead of Tavily.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Serper** joins the queue as the ninth provider kind (`serper`, credential `SERPER_API_KEY` — same `,`-joined key-pool format), implemented against the current documented contract (serper.dev's API playground; a faithful OpenAPI mirror at openapisearch.com/openapi/serper; keyless behavior verified live against the endpoint): `POST https://google.serper.dev/search` with the key in the `X-API-KEY` header (the API knows no bearer form) and the query as a JSON body (`{"q": …}`). The documented `num` ("Amount of results 10-100 (default 10)") is clamped into that 10–100 window and sent ONLY when the request carries a result count; an unspecified count inherits the API default and the parameter is not sent at all. A count below 10 clamps UP to the window floor, which never over-delivers: the web seam truncates `sources[]` to the request's `maxResults` after the provider returns. Responses map `organic[]` (`link` → url, `title` → title, `snippet` → snippet, `date` — Google's displayed date string, not normalized ISO — → `publishedAt`); a body without an `organic` array fails the attempt so the queue falls through, and non-2xx bodies of the API's `{"message": …, "statusCode": …}` shape (e.g. HTTP 403 `Unauthorized. Sign up for a free account.`) surface their message through the shared error path. A proxy base drops into the entry's `baseURL` override with the `/search` path appended like every POST adapter.
- The shipped default queue (config `DEFAULT_QUEUE` and the `cordis.patch.yml` base layer) now enables all nine kinds; the settings card names the new kind (Serper, en + zh), shows its key-format placeholder (`xxxx…` — Serper keys carry no prefix) and default endpoint base (`https://google.serper.dev`), and queues it through the same `+` row.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.1.8; the upstream attribution `User-Agent` follows (`dsh-web-search-aggregation/0.1.8`).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **SerpApi** joins the queue as the eighth provider kind (`serpapi`, credential `SERPAPI_API_KEY` — same `,`-joined key-pool format), implemented against the current documented contract (serpapi.com/search-api, serpapi.com/organic-results, serpapi.com/api-status-and-error-codes): `GET https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google&q=…&api_key=…`. The key rides the URL because SerpApi's docs require it there — "not in HTTP headers, form data, or anywhere else" — so no Authorization header is sent. The documented `num` (default 10, up to 100) is clamped to 1–100 and sent ONLY when the request carries a result count: SerpApi notes `num`-bearing calls are historically more CAPTCHA-prone, so an unspecified count inherits the API default. Responses map `organic_results[]` (`link` → url, `title` → title, `snippet` → snippet, `date` → `publishedAt`); a body whose only payload is a top-level `error` string is a failure EVEN at HTTP 200 (e.g. Google returning nothing reports `status: "Success"` plus `"Google hasn't returned any results…"`) and fails the attempt so the queue falls through. A proxy base drops into the entry's `baseURL` override.
- The shipped default queue (config `DEFAULT_QUEUE` and the `cordis.patch.yml` base layer) now enables all eight kinds; the settings card names the new kind (SerpApi, en + zh), shows its key-format placeholder (`xxxx…` — SerpApi keys are 64-hex, no prefix) and default endpoint base (`https://serpapi.com`), and queues it through the same `+` row.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.1.7; the upstream attribution `User-Agent` follows (`dsh-web-search-aggregation/0.1.7`).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Jina Search** joins the queue as the seventh provider kind (`jina`, credential `JINA_API_KEY` — same `,`-joined key-pool format), implemented against the current Search Foundation contract (docs.jina.ai; live spec at `s.jina.ai/openapi.json`): `POST https://s.jina.ai/` with a Bearer key and the query as a JSON body (`{"q": …}`). The documented `X-Respond-With: no-content` keeps an attempt SERP-only — each row returns title / url / description / publishedTime with no per-page fetch latency or token cost (`X-Retain-Images: none` too); `description` → snippet and `publishedTime` → `publishedAt`. `num` is clamped to the API's 1–20 window and sent ONLY when the request carries a result count (Jina's docs warn it adds latency otherwise; an unspecified count inherits the API default of 10). The JSON envelope (`{code, status, data: […]}`) is mapped defensively — a bare array is accepted too — and the EU-residency mirror (`https://eu.s.jina.ai`) or a proxy base drops into the entry's `baseURL` override. Anonymous search is rejected by the API (401 `AuthenticationRequiredError`, verified live), so the entry requires its credential and falls through until it is set.
- The shipped default queue (config `DEFAULT_QUEUE` and the `cordis.patch.yml` base layer) now enables all seven kinds; the settings card names the new kind (Jina Search, en + zh), shows its key-format placeholder (`jina_xxxx…`) and default endpoint base (`https://s.jina.ai`), and queues it through the same `+` row.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.1.6; the upstream attribution `User-Agent` follows (`dsh-web-search-aggregation/0.1.6`).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- The default per-attempt timeout (`attemptTimeoutMs`) drops from 15000 ms to 10000 ms, so five to six full fallbacks now fit inside the 60 s tool-level budget. Explicitly configured values (settings card or hand-written `settings.yaml`) are unaffected.
- Version bumped to 0.1.5; the upstream attribution `User-Agent` follows (`dsh-web-search-aggregation/0.1.5`).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Three new queue providers, each behind its own adapter and single fixed credential (same `,`-joined key-pool format): **Brave Search** (`brave`, `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` — `GET api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search` with `X-Subscription-Token`, count clamped to the API's 1–20 window, `text_decorations=false` for clean snippets, `page_age` → `publishedAt`), **Exa** (`exa`, `EXA_API_KEY` — `POST api.exa.ai/search` with Bearer per current docs, `numResults` clamped to 1–100, `contents: {highlights: true}` so each row's first highlight rides the snippet), and **Firecrawl** (`firecrawl`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` — `POST api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search` with Bearer, `limit` clamped to 1–100, no `scrapeOptions` so a search costs no per-page scrape credits; `success: false` envelopes map to `WEB_PROVIDER_ERROR`).
- The shipped default queue (config `DEFAULT_QUEUE` and the `cordis.patch.yml` base layer) now enables all six kinds. The queue's order is the user's to arrange in the card, so the defaults state membership — one enabled entry per kind — and not priority; the key-required entries fall through until their credential is set.
- The settings card names the three new kinds (Brave Search / Exa / Firecrawl, en + zh), shows their key-format placeholders (`xxxx…` / `fc-xxxx…`) and default endpoint bases, and queues them through the same `+` row.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.1.4; the upstream attribution `User-Agent` follows (`dsh-web-search-aggregation/0.1.4`).

### Fixed

- The adapter test helper's fetch stub passed the *request* init as the *response* init, so a stubbed non-2xx status was silently ignored (the AnySearch 429 test passed via the business-error path instead); the stub now applies the intended response status, and the Exa 401 test exercises the real HTTP path.
- Network-level fetch failures are now diagnosable: undici's opaque `TypeError: fetch failed` is unwrapped and the underlying cause (errno code + message, e.g. `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN api.search.brave.com [EAI_AGAIN]`) rides the failure record instead of being dropped.
- A transient network failure (embedded-DNS blip like `EAI_AGAIN`/`ENOTFOUND`, connection reset, dial timeout) no longer kills the attempt outright: `jsonRequest` retries once after a 150 ms backoff, inside the same attempt budget (the caller's signal still bounds the loop, so worst-case timing is unchanged). Deterministic failures — HTTP status errors, malformed bodies, aborts — are never retried.
- **Brave requests hit the wrong URL** — `braveURL` set the query parameters but never appended the `/res/v1/web/search` path, so a default-base request went to the apex `https://api.search.brave.com/?q=…`, which answers `301` to the dashboard site; with `redirect: 'error'` that surfaced as `TypeError: fetch failed: unexpected redirect`. The path is now appended to the base exactly like the POST adapters append theirs, so a proxy-prefixed base keeps its prefix.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Configuration-card copy slimmed down: the card description is one line (按优先级队列依次调用 AnySearch / TinyFish / Tavily 完成网页搜索); the enable/disable hint now sits inline after the checkbox instead of on its own row; the API-keys hint and the Base URL hint are gone (the inputs are self-explanatory).
- The API-keys input's placeholder now follows the entry's provider key format (`as_sk_xxxx…` / `sk-tinyfish-xxxx…` / `tvly-xxxx…`), and the Base URL input's placeholder is the provider's actual default endpoint — both swap live when the entry's provider changes.
- `src/defaults.ts` is now the single source for the per-kind constants (provider kinds, credential refs, key-format placeholders, default base URLs) and the attempt-timeout bounds; the host adapters/config and the browser card both import them, replacing the hand-mirrored client copies.

### Fixed

- The upstream attribution `User-Agent` (`dsh-web-search-aggregation/0.1.0`) is bumped with the package version; it was stale since 0.1.0.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Queue-entry layout spacing in the configuration card.
- CI installs with pnpm 11.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Source installs (`dsh plugin add github:…` and CI) no longer fail during the `prepare` build: `unrun` is now a devDependency. tsdown's `auto` config loader needs it to read `tsdown.config.ts` on runtimes without native TypeScript support; registry installs were unaffected (they ship prebuilt `lib/`).
- `engines.node` now states DSH's own floor (`^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`) instead of a not-actually-supported `>=20` — tsdown's build needs Node ≥ 22, and DSH hosts always run ≥ 22.19. The CI matrix (Node 22 / 24) mirrors it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- `AggregatedSearchProvider` (id `aggregated`): one `WebSearchProvider` over a prioritized queue of AnySearch / TinyFish / Tavily entries. Per request it walks enabled entries in configured order; within an entry it walks the keys parsed from the kind's single credential (a `,`-joined pool) starting at a rotating cursor; the first attempt that returns wins and every failure is recorded so an all-failed call can report each attempt.
- Adapters for the three shipped upstreams: AnySearch (`POST /v1/search`, Bearer optional — anonymous access allowed), Tavily (`POST /search`, Bearer, `max_results` + generated answer), TinyFish (`GET ?query=…`, `X-API-Key`).
- Per-attempt deadline (`attemptTimeoutMs`, default 15000 ms, range 1000–60000): one hung upstream cannot eat the tool-level budget.
- Key-pool vocabulary (`parseApiKeys` / `formatApiKeys` / `keyRefLabel` / `maskApiKey`): one credential per provider kind holds all its keys joined by `,`; logs and failure records cite masked `REF` / `REF#N` labels only.
- Browser-half configuration card (设置 → 插件 → 插件配置 → *Aggregated web search*): live queue editing (reorder, enable/disable, add/remove entries, per-entry endpoint override), masked key tags with presence facts only (a save replaces the whole pool; stored values are never echoed back), the attempt timeout, and a queue-level reset — committed changes reach the next search without a restart.
- `cordis.patch.yml` bundle layer: pins the web seam's `searchProvider` to `aggregated` and inserts the plugin row carrying the shipped default queue (`anysearch → tavily → tinyfish`) as the settings section's base layer. The patch states only `searchProvider` — deployments combining other provider plugins pin their full selection in the profile's own `cordis.patch.yml` (documented in the README).
- Unit tests (61): config schema and normalization, key-pool helpers, adapter request/response mapping, provider queue walk (rotation, fallback, deadlines, cancellation, failure summaries), and the client controller's staged edits.
